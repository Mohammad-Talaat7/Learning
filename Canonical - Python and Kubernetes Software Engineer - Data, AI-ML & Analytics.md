# Education
---------

- ## How did you rank in your final year of high school in mathematics? Were you a top student? On what basis would you say that?
	- In my High School I ranked in the top 5% in mathematics as far as I can remember.
	- I loved mathematics puzzles since I was a kid killing my time in learning new interesting mathematical theory which made me one of the top students in both mathematics and physics.
	- I say that as I participated in my high school's special exams for top students.

- ## How did you rank in your final year of high school, in your home language? Were you a top student? On what basis would you say that?
	- In my home language I ranked in the top 5% as far as I can remember and I think that mainly because my home language is hard to study and most of the students but me just ignored it.
	- Yes in my home and foreign language I was from the top students.
	- I say that as I participated in my high school's special exams for top students.

- ## Please state your high school graduation results or university entrance results, and explain the grading system used. For example, in the US, you might give your SAT or ACT scores. In Germany, you might give your scores out of a grading system of 1-5, with 1 being the best.
	- My high School was ranking students by scaling their grades in percentage way and as far as I can remember I graduated from high school with 92% (Excellent in the US grading system).

- ## Can you make a case that you are in the top 5% in your academic year, or top 1%, or even higher? If so please outline that case. Make reference where possible to standardised testing results at regional or national level, or university entrance results. Please explain any specific grading system used.
	- I fact I can't as my high school not even have a website on it's own I think the only way to outline it will be the records of the special exams in years 2016, 2017, and 2018 but that's a governmental records I can't access them.

- ## What sort of high school student were you? Outside of class, what were your interests and hobbies? What would your high school peers remember you for?
	- I think I was the nerd guy in the class I had a very little group of friends and didn't really want to expand that group as I wanted to really focus on getting into a Computer Science College as it was my dream since I was young.
	- Outside of class I would be either studying, reading a book, cooking, Reading manga, Watching Anime, or killing time on computer trying to learn a new skill or just playing video games (I really loved playing video games) .
	- My peers would mostly remember me eating in the restaurant in front of our school (I really spent a lot of time in it).

- ## Which university and degree did you choose? What other universities did you consider, and why did you select that one?
	- I got into El-Shrouk Academy Computer Science department.
	- At that time I considered getting into Cairo University or getting into Engineering Department but in the end I chose El-Shrouk Academy due to it's professors and the great reputation the academy have.

- ## Overall, what was your degree result and how did that reflect on your ability? Please help us understand the grading system for your results.
	- I graduated from my university with B degree (B+ in US grading system).
	- our grading system was pretty much like high school just summing the total grad for each student and then scale it and give students their success percentage over all subjects in each semester then by summing the total grad of the two semesters and scaling it they give the result for each year and by that they calculate the overall result for the whole academic journey.
	- Note that in the graduation project I have got an excellent with honor degree (A+ in US grading system) and the real reason that I got B in overall grads was because I was completely focused on my courses and self-learning road and was mentored by one of the greatest professors that we had.

- ## During all of your education years, from high school to university,Â  can you describe any achievements that were truly exceptional?
	- Well nothing is truly exceptional but for me I think my ability to study and teaching programming and tech. while doing my military services was a great achievement at least that's for me.

- ## What leadership roles did you take on during your education? Have you conceived and driven to completion any initiatives outside of your required classwork?
	- I was the leader of the AI Learning Group we founded it in the first year and was mentored by our professors I was responsible of teaching my classmates the foundation of using AI and ML techniques.
	- Since I was accepted in the college I started taking courses outside my required classwork to enhance my knowledge and to keep the ability to share this knowledge with my classmates and friends.



# Engineering experience
---

- ## What kinds of software projects have you worked on before? Which operating systems, development environments, languages, databases?
	- Most of my projects are in the AI/ML field although my graduation project was in computer vision field.
	- most of it was running on linux operating system (Ubuntu - Fedora) using Spyder or Jupyter Lab as the development environments and python as it's main language and for databases MSQL (although I didn't work on databases before my most experience in python and AI/ML algorithms).

- ## Give details of your Python software development experience to date, how would you rate your competency with Python?
	- Currently I'm learning how to program CUDA programs using python and how to use it to optimize my python projects, I'm learning through NVIDIA Docs and the CUDA series training provided to Oakland National Laboratory that is opened to the public, also I'm now developing my own library and plan to publish it on Python Package Index (PyPI) when it's finished my goal is to develop a python package that enables a beginner to implement a whole AI/ML algorithm in few codes starting from reading data and ending with evaluating the code and visualize the results with high customization it can work with any way the user want and with any datatype too (with that said I have to say that I'm still in the begin of that project).
	- In a scale from 1 to 10 I would say that I'm 9.5 in python I have spent 5-6 years learning it and working with it.

- ## Give details of your Go software development experience to date, how would you rate your competency with Go?
	- Honestly all I know about it is that it's used in cloud and server-side applications, DevOps, and Command line Tools and that it was intended to replace popular high-performance server-side languages like Java or C++ and being written in Assembly and C++ makes it really efficient I guess.
	- In a scale from 1 to 10 I would be 2 in Go as all I know is basic syntax.

- ## Which project or piece of software are you most proud of, and why?
	- The project I'm most proud of so far would be my Graduation project It was an application that can analyze any kind of medical rays and diagnose it too and return the type of the rays used, the diagnose, and the object classified version of the medical ray if there was any thing wrong in it (like nails, plates or even tumors).
	- It was so challenging project we first had to find where would we get the data from and ended using the Stanford AIMI Shared Datasets then augmenting the data and benchmarking couple of AI models for image classification for each medical ray, image classification to determine the type of the rays, object detection, and object classification.
	- I was in charge of mentoring the benchmarking phase and developing new models for image classification for X-Rays I started using simple models like VGG but it couldn't learn well from data and therefor couldn't generalize well for new data then I tried the Inception model It generalized with a good accuracy (we used the mean-squared error technique) but not the best there was still room for some improvements (due to the vanishing gradient problem) so I decided to implement the ResNet model but it returned a really amazing accuracy but overfits completely so I used techniques like early stopping and Lasso Regularization also spend more time augmenting our data and ended up with a really amazing results (99.9 training accuracy/99.8 validation accuracy/99.8 testing accuracy).
	- Note that any model used in our project either being part of the project in the end or stopped at the benchmarking phase was implemented using only Pytorch, numPy, and pandas libraries.

- ## Give details of any experience you have with automated provisioning tools, configuration management and infrastructure-as-code
	- Honestly I have no experience in that field but I'm willing to learn more.

- ## How comprehensive is your knowledge of Linux, from the kernel up? How familiar are you with low-level system architecture, runtimes, packaging and command line tooling?
	- I'm using Linux as my main OS for 4 years (Ubuntu - Fedora) But honestly my technical information of it isn't strong enough as I didn't have the need to dive deep.

- ## Describe your experience with public cloud based operations - how well do you understand large-scale public cloud estate management and developer experience?
	- Again I have nearly no experience in Cloud base operations or applications but I'm willing to learn in path of becoming better developer and helping humanity.

- ## Outline your thoughts on quality in software development. What practices are most effective to drive improvements in quality?
	- In my opinion maintaining a good quality since the start of the project is very important and to ensure it is better to use Agile methodology, and test the project really well (Unit test - Feature test - Integration test) also keep an eye on project's performance by profiling it's time and space complexity while developing and maybe the most important thing in my mind is to plan well for the project, analyzing the requirements, and planning each step properly.

- ## Outline your thoughts on documentation in software projects. What practices should teams follow? What are great examples of open source docs?
	- In my opinion Documenting the project is very important as it helps end-user to understand how actually the project works and how to use it properly also it helps to maintain the project in the future.
	- In my opinion the best practice is to start documenting with the start of the project.
	- Using Open Source Docs helps a lot when it comes to documenting the project **MkDocs** is good and simple and have wide choice of themes.
