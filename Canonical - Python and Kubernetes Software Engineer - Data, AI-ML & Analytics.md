- ## How did you rank in your final year of high school in mathematics? Were you a top student? On what basis would you say that?
	- In my High School I ranked in the top 5% in mathematics as far as I can remember.
	- I loved mathematics puzzles since I was a kid killing my time in learning new interesting mathematical theory which made me one of the top students in both mathematics and physics.
	- I say that as I participated in my high school's special exams for top students.

- ## How did you rank in your final year of high school, in your home language? Were you a top student? On what basis would you say that?
	- In my home language I ranked in the top 5% as far as I can remember and I think that mainly because my home language is hard to study and most of the students but me just ignored it.
	- Yes in my home and foreign language I was from the top students.
	- I say that as I participated in my high school's special exams for top students.

- ## Please state your high school graduation results or university entrance results, and explain the grading system used. For example, in the US, you might give your SAT or ACT scores. In Germany, you might give your scores out of a grading system of 1-5, with 1 being the best.
	- My high School was ranking students by scaling their grades in percentage way and as far as I can remember I graduated from high school with 92% (Excellent in the US grading system).

- ## Can you make a case that you are in the top 5% in your academic year, or top 1%, or even higher? If so please outline that case. Make reference where possible to standardised testing results at regional or national level, or university entrance results. Please explain any specific grading system used.
	- I fact I can't as my high school not even have a website on it's own I think the only way to outline it will be the records of the special exams in years 2016, 2017, and 2018 but that's a governmental records I can't access them.

- ## What sort of high school student were you? Outside of class, what were your interests and hobbies? What would your high school peers remember you for?
	- I think I was the nerd guy in the class I had a very little group of friends and didn't really want to expand that group as I wanted to really focus on getting into a Computer Science College as it was my dream since I was young.
	- Outside of class I would be either studying or killing time on computer trying to learn a new skill or just playing video games.
	- My peers would mostly remember me eating in the restaurant in front of our school (I really spent a lot of time in it).
