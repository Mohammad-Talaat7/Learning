# Tabular and Tidy Data
- **Tabular Data** is about organizing data in tables shape with observations as rows and features as columns and with values in its intersections
![[Pasted image 20241218013810.png]]
- The principles of **Tidy Data** means:
	- Each row corresponds to a single house in our dataset. We'll call each of these houses an **observation**.
	- Each column corresponds to a characteristic of each house. We'll call these **features**.
	- Each cell contains only one **value**.

- To store data in **Tabular Form** we can store it in *list* data type
```python
# Declare variable `house_0_list`
house_0_list = [115910.26, 128, 4]

# Print object type of `house_0_list`
print("house_0_list type:", type(house_0_list))

# Print length of `house_0_list`
print("house_0_list length:", len(house_0_list))

# Get output of `house_0_list`
house_0_list
```

```python
# Declare variable `houses_nested_list`
houses_nested_list = [
    [115910.26, 128.0, 4.0],
    [48718.17, 210.0, 3.0],
    [28977.56, 58.0, 2.0],
    [36932.27, 79.0, 3.0],
    [83903.51, 111.0, 3.0],
]

# Print `houses_nested_list` type
print("houses_nested_list type:", type(houses_nested_list))

# Print `houses_nested_list` length
print("houses_nested_list length:", len(houses_nested_list))

# Get output of `houses_nested_list`
houses_nested_list
```

- We can also work with directions to label our features in a better way to implement row-wise operations and column-wise operations better
```python
# Declare variable `house_0_dict`
house_0_dict = {
    "price_approx_usd": 115910.26,
    "surface_covered_in_m2": 128,
    "rooms": 4,
}

# Print `house_0_dict` type
print("house_0_dict type:", type(house_0_dict))

# Get output of `house_0_dict`
house_0_dict
```

- We can store our directions to label our features in a row-wise like that:
```python
# Declare variable `houses_rowwise`
houses_rowwise = [
    {
        "price_approx_usd": 115910.26,
        "surface_covered_in_m2": 128,
        "rooms": 4,
    },
    {
        "price_approx_usd": 48718.17,
        "surface_covered_in_m2": 210,
        "rooms": 3,
    },
    {
        "price_approx_usd": 28977.56,
        "surface_covered_in_m2": 58,
        "rooms": 2,
    },
    {
        "price_approx_usd": 36932.27,
        "surface_covered_in_m2": 79,
        "rooms": 3,
    },
    {
        "price_approx_usd": 83903.51,
        "surface_covered_in_m2": 111,
        "rooms": 3,
    },
]

# Print `houses_rowwise` object type
print("houses_rowwise type:", type(houses_rowwise))

# Print `houses_rowwise` length
print("houses_rowwise length:", len(houses_rowwise))

# Get output of `houses_rowwise`
houses_rowwise
```

- We can store our directions to label our observations in a column-wise like that:
```python
# Declare variable `houses_columnwise`
houses_columnwise = {
    "price_approx_usd": [115910.26, 48718.17, 28977.56, 36932.27, 83903.51],
    "surface_covered_in_m2": [128.0, 210.0, 58.0, 79.0, 111.0],
    "rooms": [4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 3.0, 3.0],
}

# Print `houses_columnwise` object type
print("houses_columnwise type:", type(houses_columnwise))

# Get output of `houses_columnwise`
houses_columnwise
```

# Data Wrangling with Pandas
- When working in data science field it's better to use *Pandas* or *Polars* for storing tabular data and augmenting it as this way offers more efficient way for reading and manipulating data
```python
# Import pandas library, aliased as `pd`
import pandas as pd

# Declare variable `df_houses`
df_houses = pd.DataFrame(houses_columnwise)

# Print `df_houses` object type
print("df_houses type:", type(df_houses))

# Print `df_houses` shape
print("df_houses shape:", df_houses.shape)

# Get output of `df_houses`
df_houses
```
